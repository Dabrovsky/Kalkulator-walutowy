# Currency Calculator

> Hi! This is a simple **currency calculator** page coded and designed by me [@Dabrovsky](https://github.com/Dabrovsky)<br/>Build to learn my coding skills.

### Functions:

* Currency conversion
* Average exchange rates
* Last 10 average currency quotations
* History of generated calculations

## Update 2019!

### What I want to do:

* Refactor CSS code to SCSS
* Implement BEM methodology
* Refactor JavaScript code to implement Classes and separate it into components
* Implement Webpack bundler
